## What is Factory Floor?

Factory Floor is a native macOS app built on [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org)'s GPU-rendered terminal. It manages multiple parallel development tasks, each in its own git worktree with a dedicated Claude Code agent, terminal, and browser.

**One project, many workstreams, all at native speed.**

### Features

- **Git Worktrees** &mdash; Each workstream gets its own branch and worktree. Switch between tasks without stashing.
- **Claude Code** &mdash; Integrated AI agent with session persistence. Resume conversations across app restarts.
- **Tmux Persistence** &mdash; Agent sessions survive app restarts via tmux on a dedicated socket.
- **Setup & Run Scripts** &mdash; Configure setup, run, and teardown scripts per project. Compatible with [emdash](https://emdash.sh), [conductor](https://conductor.build), and [superset](https://superset.sh) configs.
- **Embedded Browser** &mdash; WKWebView tab with deterministic port allocation per workstream.
- **GitHub Integration** &mdash; Repo info, open PRs, and branch PR status via the `gh` CLI.
- **Dynamic Tabs** &mdash; Open as many terminals and browsers as you need. Close with Cmd+W or Ctrl+D.
- **Keyboard-first** &mdash; Every action has a shortcut. Cmd+Return for agent, Cmd+I for info, Cmd+T for terminal, Cmd+B for browser.

### Script Configuration

Add a `.factoryfloor.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "setup": "npm install",
  "run": "PORT=$FF_PORT npm run dev",
  "teardown": "docker-compose down"
}
```

Or use your existing config from emdash (`.emdash.json`), conductor (`conductor.json`), or superset (`.superset/config.json`).

### Environment Variables

Every workstream terminal has access to:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `FF_PROJECT` | Project name |
| `FF_WORKSTREAM` | Workstream name |
| `FF_PROJECT_DIR` | Main repository path |
| `FF_WORKTREE_DIR` | Worktree path for this workstream |
| `FF_PORT` | Deterministic port (40001-49999) |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

#### Global

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+N` | New workstream or project |
| `Cmd+Shift+N` | New project |
| `Cmd+,` | Settings |
| `Cmd+Shift+?` | Help |

#### Workstream

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+Return` | Focus Coding Agent |
| `Cmd+I` | Info panel |
| `Cmd+T` | New Terminal |
| `Cmd+B` | New Browser |
| `Cmd+W` | Close tab |
| `Cmd+L` | Address bar (browser) |

## Development

Requires: Xcode, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) (`brew install xcodegen`), [Zig](https://ziglang.org) (`brew install zig`).

```bash
# First time: build the Ghostty terminal engine
cd ghostty && zig build -Demit-xcframework=true -Dxcframework-target=universal -Doptimize=ReleaseFast && cd ..

# Build
./scripts/dev.sh build

# Build and run
./scripts/dev.sh br

# Kill and relaunch
./scripts/dev.sh run

# Run with a specific directory
./scripts/dev.sh run ~/repos/myproject

# Run tests
./scripts/dev.sh test

# Clean
./scripts/dev.sh clean

# Release (sign, notarize, DMG)
./scripts/release.sh 0.1.0
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for development workflow, architecture, and conventions.

### Website

The website lives in `website/` and is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

```bash
cd website && bun install && bun run dev
```

### Localization

All strings are localized. To add a language:

1. Copy `Localization/en.lproj` to `Localization/xx.lproj`
2. Translate all values in `Localizable.strings`
3. Add the path to `project.yml` and run `xcodegen generate`
