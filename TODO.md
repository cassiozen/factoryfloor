# TODO

## Security

- [x] Pin third-party CI actions to commit SHAs (supply chain protection)
- [x] CI notarization: use keychain profile instead of passing Apple password as CLI arg
- [x] Scope CI permissions per job (release-please: contents+PRs, build: contents only)
- [x] GitOperations.sanitize: strip leading `-` to prevent git flag injection
- [x] .env symlink: validate source is a regular file, not itself a symlink to sensitive data
- [x] Remove website/node_modules from repo, add to .gitignore, install via bun in CI

## Bugs

- [x] BrowserView: "Press Cmd+Shift+B to retry" hint is wrong (removed misleading hint and dead notification)
- [x] Settings/Help persisted as selection: app reopens to Settings if quit while in Settings (fixed)
- [x] Detached HEAD inconsistency: normalize "HEAD" to nil so all views show "detached"
- [x] Path collision: worktree names differing only by `/` vs `-` (now uses `--` for `/`)
- [x] Surface cleanup in removeWorkstreamSurfaces (now iterates until no more matches instead of hard cap)

## UX

- [x] Show error feedback when worktree creation fails (alert instead of silent broken workstream)
- [x] Show install prompt when Claude CLI is not found (instead of plain shell)
- [x] Setup/run scripts: visible in Environment tab with split terminals and re-execute buttons
- [x] Execute the `run` script from .factoryfloor.json (Environment tab, right pane)
- [x] Notify user when a project directory is removed from disk (alert with project names)
- [x] Onboarding: prerequisites with live status, getting started steps, key concepts
- [x] Show error dialog when ghostty_init fails (NSAlert instead of fatalError)
- [x] ToolRow: text already shown alongside color dot (no change needed)
- [x] Add copy-branch-name button alongside copy-path in workstream info header
- [ ] the footer "Built by David Poblador i Garcia with the support of All Tuner Labs" should be in one line, but perhaps with a shorter wording
- [ ] the website needs a prominent link somewhere to the sponsor page to support the development

## Accessibility

- [x] Add accessibilityLabel/accessibilityHint to all interactive elements
- [x] Make hover-only actions (archive, delete, add) visible via opacity when not hovered
- [x] Restore focus rings on .buttonStyle(.plain) buttons (.borderless) for keyboard navigation

## Code Quality

- [x] Extract duplicated abbreviatePath into a shared String extension (PathUtilities.swift)
- [x] Remove duplicated performArchive logic between ContentView and ProjectSidebar
- [x] bleedingEdge setting: intentionally kept for future auto-update (Sparkle) channel selection
- [x] Remove dead retryBrowser notification (declared and observed but never posted)
- [x] ToolStatus.detect: remove misleading async signature (contains no await)
- [x] Localization: add missing strings for Settings sections, HelpView, BrowserView error UI, ProjectOverviewView
- [x] Remove stale unused keys from Localizable.strings files (already cleaned)
- [x] surfaceRegistry thread safety: action_cb runs on main thread, deinit removal dispatched to main
- [x] Fix derivedUUID misleading comment (says SHA-256 but uses simple byte folding)
- [x] Cache claudeCommand computed property (builds CommandBuilder on every render)
- [x] Consolidate polling timers (PR refresh moved to AppEnvironment, single 15s timer)
- [x] Parallelize refreshPathValidity git calls (TaskGroup)

## Future

- [ ] Swift 6 migration (strict concurrency)
- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle or similar)
- [ ] Crash reporting
- [x] Move persistence from UserDefaults to JSON files (~/.config/factoryfloor/) with auto-migration
- [ ] Horizontal terminal splits within a tab (ghostty C API supports splits via action_cb, but surface lifecycle needs investigation)
- [ ] Preload Coding Agent terminal in background so it's ready when the user switches from Info tab
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder tabs
- [ ] Show project icon in info pages if found in a well-known location (e.g., icon.png, .github/icon.png)
- [ ] Pin ghostty submodule update to CI (auto-test against new Ghostty releases)
- [ ] Occlude non-visible terminal surfaces to save GPU (needs careful timing)
- [ ] System notifications when agent needs attention (bell/urgency from Ghostty)
- [x] OG image: branded banner with app name, logo, and Poblenou skyline
- [ ] Restore full app state on launch (active tab within workstream; sidebar selection and expanded state already persisted)
