# TODO

## Pre-release

- [ ] Take app screenshots for the website (workspace view, sidebar, terminal, environment tab)

## Post-release

- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle): in-app update for direct DMG users
- [ ] Clean remaining build warnings and flip the project to Swift 6
- [ ] Port detection: auto-detect when run script opens a listening port, point browser to it (scoped in docs/port-detection.md)
- [ ] Crash reporting

## Future

- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] Horizontal terminal splits within a tab (ghostty C API supports splits)
- [ ] System notifications when agent needs attention (bell/urgency from Ghostty)
