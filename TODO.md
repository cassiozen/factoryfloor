# TODO

## Security

- [ ] Pin third-party CI actions to commit SHAs instead of mutable tags (supply chain risk)
- [ ] CI notarization: use keychain profile instead of passing Apple password as CLI arg
- [ ] Scope CI permissions per job (release-please needs write, build only needs contents:write)
- [x] GitOperations.sanitize: strip leading `-` to prevent git flag injection
- [x] .env symlink: validate source is a regular file, not itself a symlink to sensitive data
- [x] Remove website/node_modules from repo, add to .gitignore, install via bun in CI

## Bugs

- [x] BrowserView: "Press Cmd+Shift+B to retry" hint is wrong (removed misleading hint and dead notification)
- [x] Settings/Help persisted as selection: app reopens to Settings if quit while in Settings (fixed)
- [x] Detached HEAD inconsistency: normalize "HEAD" to nil so all views show "detached"
- [x] Path collision: worktree names differing only by `/` vs `-` (now uses `--` for `/`)
- [ ] Surface cleanup in removeWorkstreamSurfaces hard-capped at 20 tabs (orphans surfaces beyond that)

## UX

- [ ] Show error feedback when worktree creation fails (currently adds broken workstream silently)
- [ ] Show banner or message when claude CLI is not installed (agent tab just opens plain shell)
- [ ] Setup script: log output or show status instead of routing to /dev/null and ignoring exit code
- [ ] Notify user when a project directory is removed from disk (currently silently removes from sidebar)
- [ ] Onboarding: explain prerequisites (claude, gh), what a workstream is, Cmd+N contextual behavior
- [ ] Execute the `run` script from .factoryfloor.json (currently loaded and displayed but never run)
- [ ] Show error dialog when ghostty_init or ghostty_app_new fails (currently crashes or shows blank)
- [ ] ToolRow: add shape/text indicator alongside color dot for authentication status (color-only info)
- [ ] Add copy-branch-name button alongside copy-path in workstream info header

## Accessibility

- [ ] Add accessibilityLabel/accessibilityHint to all interactive elements
- [ ] Make hover-only actions (archive, delete, add) reachable via keyboard
- [ ] Restore focus rings on .buttonStyle(.plain) buttons for keyboard navigation

## Code Quality

- [x] Extract duplicated abbreviatePath into a shared String extension (PathUtilities.swift)
- [ ] Remove duplicated performArchive logic between ContentView and ProjectSidebar
- [ ] Remove dead bleedingEdge setting (toggle exists but nothing reads it, keep for future auto-update)
- [x] Remove dead retryBrowser notification (declared and observed but never posted)
- [x] ToolStatus.detect: remove misleading async signature (contains no await)
- [ ] Localization: add missing strings for Settings sections, HelpView, BrowserView error UI, ProjectOverviewView
- [ ] Remove stale unused keys from Localizable.strings files
- [ ] surfaceRegistry thread safety: confirm ghostty callback threading contract
- [x] Fix derivedUUID misleading comment (says SHA-256 but uses simple byte folding)
- [ ] Cache claudeCommand computed property (builds CommandBuilder on every render)
- [ ] Consolidate polling timers (15s in ContentView + 30s in TerminalContainerView per workstream)
- [ ] Parallelize refreshPathValidity git calls (currently 4N sequential subprocesses)

## Future

- [ ] Swift 6 migration (strict concurrency)
- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle or similar)
- [ ] Crash reporting
- [ ] Move persistence from UserDefaults to a proper file (for larger state)
- [ ] Horizontal terminal splits within a tab (ghostty C API supports splits via action_cb, but surface lifecycle needs investigation)
- [ ] Preload Coding Agent terminal in background so it's ready when the user switches from Info tab
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder tabs
- [ ] Show project icon in info pages if found in a well-known location (e.g., icon.png, .github/icon.png)
- [ ] Pin ghostty submodule update to CI (auto-test against new Ghostty releases)
- [ ] Occlude non-visible terminal surfaces to save GPU (needs careful timing)
- [ ] System notifications when agent needs attention (bell/urgency from Ghostty)
- [ ] OG image: proper 1200x630 banner with app name and tagline for social sharing
- [ ] Restore full app state on launch (active tab within workstream; sidebar selection and expanded state already persisted)
