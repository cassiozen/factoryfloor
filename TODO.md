# TODO

## Active

- [ ] Background launch: start Coding Agent and environment scripts while Info tab is visible
- [ ] Localize remaining hardcoded strings (EnvironmentTabView, tab labels, context menus, CLI install, HelpView credits)

## Website

- [x] Fix homepage title for SEO (now "Factory Floor - AI-powered development workspace for macOS")
- [x] Remove dead _index.md content (was never rendered by layout)
- [ ] Take app screenshots for the website (workspace view, sidebar, terminal, environment tab)

## Code Quality

- [ ] Cache projectIndex/workstreamIndex in ProjectSidebar (rebuild on every render)
- [x] Move derivedUUID to PathUtilities.swift
- [x] Move retroactive String/UUID Identifiable conformances to PathUtilities
- [x] FilePersistence: drop redundant .atomic on temp write

## Pre-release

- [x] Ensure docs/distribution.md is up to date with current CI, signing, Homebrew, and release workflow
- [x] Document version release routine (in docs/distribution.md)
- [ ] Plan distribution and auto-update strategy: compare Mac App Store vs Homebrew vs direct DMG vs Sparkle; document tradeoffs (Homebrew is a must regardless)

## Future

- [ ] Swift 6 migration (strict concurrency)
- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle or similar)
- [ ] Crash reporting
- [ ] Horizontal terminal splits within a tab (ghostty C API supports splits via action_cb, but surface lifecycle needs investigation)
- [ ] Preload Coding Agent terminal in background so it's ready when the user switches from Info tab
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to reorder tabs
- [ ] Show project icon in info pages if found in a well-known location (e.g., icon.png, .github/icon.png)
- [ ] Pin ghostty submodule update to CI (auto-test against new Ghostty releases)
- [ ] Occlude non-visible terminal surfaces to save GPU (needs careful timing)
- [ ] System notifications when agent needs attention (bell/urgency from Ghostty)
- [ ] Restore full app state on launch (active tab within workstream; sidebar selection and expanded state already persisted)
