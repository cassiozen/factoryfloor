# TODO

## Pre-release
- [ ] Choose final app name (currently "ff2" is a working name)
- [ ] Update bundle ID (`com.ff2.app` in project.yml), URL scheme, AppConstants
- [ ] Build and ship a standalone CLI binary (like `code` for VS Code)
- [ ] Homebrew cask for installation
- [ ] Code signing and notarization for distribution
- [ ] All Tuner Labs logo image in help view (needs asset)
- [ ] Occlude non-visible terminal surfaces to save GPU (reverted, needs careful timing)
- [ ] GitHub Pages deploy workflow for website
- [ ] Sidebar visual polish (custom styling beyond default SwiftUI)

## Future
- [ ] Split panes within a workstream
- [ ] External Chrome integration: launch with --remote-debugging-port for WebMCP/CDP
- [ ] PR management: create and manage PRs from workstreams (currently view-only)
- [ ] CommandBuilder withFallback quoting needs more testing with edge cases
- [ ] Auto-update mechanism (Sparkle or similar)
- [ ] Crash reporting
- [ ] Move persistence from UserDefaults to a proper file (for larger state)
- [ ] Add more translations (copy en.lproj to xx.lproj, translate strings)

- [x] Cmd+Shift+[/] tab cycling
- [x] Cmd+Shift+O external browser, Cmd+Shift+E external terminal
- [x] Ctrl+Cmd+S sidebar toggle
- [x] Esc closes settings/help
- [x] Help view with grouped shortcuts, credits, Poblenou skyline
- [x] Settings: environment detection, tmux, bypass, teams, auto-rename, appearance, language, base dir, branch prefix, external apps, danger zone
- [x] Project overview with editable alias, git/GitHub info, workstream list
- [x] Drag-and-drop directories to sidebar
- [x] ff2:// URL scheme for single-instance behavior
- [x] CLI launch with directory argument
- [x] Auto-generated workstream names (operation-adjective-component)
- [x] Async git repo info, path validity, GitHub data with periodic refresh
- [x] Auto-remove projects with missing directories
- [x] Worktree path validation with visual feedback (warning icon + strikethrough)
- [x] Localization: en, ca, es, sv
- [x] Performance: cached sorted IDs, O(1) lookups, debounced saves, deferred init, surface prewarm
- [x] Terminal resize flicker fix, async archive operations
- [x] CommandBuilder for clean shell command composition
- [x] Poblenou skyline as SwiftUI Shape in help and empty state
- [x] CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development workflow docs
- [x] Archive warning: warn if worktree has uncommitted changes before archiving
- [x] Workstream sorting in project view (by name or recent use toggle)
- [x] Sidebar shows branch name per workstream (refreshed periodically)
- [x] Sidebar toggle animation flicker fix
- [x] Git worktree list and prune in project overview
- [x] Fix auto-rename branch (--append-system-prompt instead of --system-prompt-file)
- [x] Extract env var injection logic to WorkstreamEnvironment module
- [x] Tmux mode limited to Coding Agent only (Terminal tab uses plain shell)
- [x] Tmux aggressive-resize and window-size latest to prevent size revert
- [x] Script config: .ff2.json with fallback to emdash/conductor/superset formats
- [x] Setup tab (Cmd+5): auto-runs setup script on workstream creation
- [x] Run tab (Cmd+6): on-demand dev server via run script
- [x] Teardown script runs before worktree removal on archive
- [x] .env symlink guarded by setting (default on)
- [x] Script info displayed in workstream Info tab
- [x] App icon (factory floor + Poblenou skyline)
- [x] Landing page website with Tailwind CSS build

## Probably not needed
- [ ] Claude Agent SDK integration (TypeScript): CLI + tmux + session-id covers our needs
